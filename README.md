# UCSB-PSTAT-100-Final-Project---World-Happiness-Report-Dataset
This is the final project for PSTAT 100 at UCSB in Fall 2024. Using Python, I analyzed the World Happiness Report dataset, creating visualizations like heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots. I also conducted regression analysis, clustering, and summarized the findings. The project will provide code, output files, and the dataset.
